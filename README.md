## Basic Info

`FUn HOg` is a 2-2.5" freestyle frame with removable arms.  The current version is a pure x (1:1), but a lateral stretch is in the works. There are several configuration possible and the design is a classic "Blackout Box" format. No need for silly over engineering to generate sales.

Wait, we are not interested in selling these frames. We may, we could, but honestly we got so and tired of all the shit out there on the market (way back in 2014) we decided to design and cut our own frames.  

## Configuration Range

Many different configurations are possible. 

* AUW is __100-150 gram__.
* 20 x 20 mm stack (PCB)
* KV range is 4000-10000. 
* 2-4s battery @ 300-650mah
* 2-2.5" prop
* 11xx motors (going to test on 1306)
* DVR ready
* XM or similar RX
* Backpack VTX / dipole
* M3 standoffs at 20-25mm 
* 3DP camera mount needed (Nano/similar)
 
Mechanical Highlights:

* Can be built with only 2 types of cut
* 2 or 3 plate designs allows for a heavier (3 plate) build using dual bottom plates
* Plates are 100% symmetrical
* Plates are interchangeable
* Arms are removable and interchangeable

Right now, here are all __48__ different known configurations:
 
1. 2" Top mount battery
1. 2.5" Top mount battery
1. 2" Underslung battery
1. 2.5" Underslung battery
1. 2" Underslung electronics (bottom box), top mount battery
1. 2.5" Underslung electronics (bottom box), top mount battery
1. 2" Underslung electronics (bottom box), underslung battery
1. 2.5" Underslung electronics (bottom box), underslung battery
1. Narrow front (2" front, 2.5" rear arms) custom mix top mount battery 
1. Tight ass (2" rear, 2.5" front arms) custom mix top mount battery
1. Narrow front (2" front, 2.5" rear arms) custom mix underslung battery
1. Tight ass (2" rear, 2.5" front arms) custom mix underslung battery
1. __Now multiply all those configuration x 2 for dual and triple plate builds__
1. __Now multiple that AGAIN for standard plate or battery strap plate__

> __Total known configuration is 48!__  #WTF

## Suggested Configuration

There are a lot of configuration possibilities, here are 2 we like so far.

### Mellow Fellow 2"

Solid 3min flights, bigger battery suggested nonetheless.  Feels like a 5", the weight is 124.5g AUW ad tames down the drivetrain a little. You have good punch, but a lower (10-15 degree) angle on the cam is recommended as this unit is designed and built to fly under cars, through windows and doors, and combine freestyle and proximity in the back yard.

* 2" arms
* HGLRC stack
* RunCam backpack VTX
* RunCam Nano (actually this camera is a pile of shit and the preferred camera has no name)
* 3DP nano case
* 1104 @6500kv
* Gem Fan 2035 x 4 blade
* M3 / 25mm stack
* XM+
* ~400mah 3s
* 2 plate build
* Top mount battery

### Bat on Fire 2.5"

Even with the lower (15 degree) angle on the camera this build gets on top of everything, you house, the trees, everything. The high RPM and bigger prop add a stability and float providing a longer inertial throw leading to more hang time stabilized by more gyroscopic effect form the blades.  We thing this unit tops out at 50mph, but most of the time it is poking at gaps in the yard and diving the trees in range.

* 2.5" arms
* HGLRC stack
* AKK 20x20 600mw VTX 
* RunCam Nano (actually this camera is a pile of shit and the preferred camera has no name)
* 3DP nano case
* 1106 @6000kv
* Gem Fan 2.5" 2540 3-Blade Propeller 
* M3 / 25mm stack
* XM+
* ~650mah 4s
* 2 plate build
* Underslung battery
